## The “Unseen” Guard of the Energy Grid

Modern smart grids are marvels of engineering—but their interdependence makes them uniquely vulnerable to cyber threats.

<Callout type="warning" title="Why This Matters">
A single compromised substation or router can trigger cascading outages affecting healthcare, finance, and national security.
</Callout>

## Why Cyber-Physical Fusion Matters

Traditional IDS solutions analyze either cyber logs or physical signals—but rarely both.

<Callout type="info" title="Fusion Advantage">
Cyber data excels at detecting ransomware and lateral movement, while physical measurements are essential for identifying False Data Injection (FDI) attacks.
</Callout>

- **Detection improvement:** up to **16%**
- **Threat coverage:** RW, BF, RS, BD

## Moving Beyond 2D Learning

Power grids are not images or sequences—they are **graphs**.

<Callout type="success" title="Topology-Aware Learning">
Graph Neural Networks preserve spatial, electrical, and cyber dependencies that traditional deep learning models discard.
</Callout>
